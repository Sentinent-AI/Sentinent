# Sentinent

## Project Description
Sentinent is a unified aggregator dashboard designed for organizations to centralize signals, messages, and notifications from multiple platforms into a single, actionable interface. It brings together communication and workflow tools such as Slack, email, GitHub Issues, and JIRA, allowing teams to monitor activity, track updates, and respond efficiently without context‑switching across applications. The goal is to improve visibility, reduce noise, and help teams stay aligned through a clean, consolidated dashboard experience.
